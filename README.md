NLP Assignments Repository
Welcome to the NLP Assignments Repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and models. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of NLP, from text preprocessing and feature extraction to advanced deep learning models for text classification and language generation.


Introduction:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. This repository provides practical examples and assignments to help you understand and apply NLP techniques using Python and popular libraries such as NLTK, Gensim, Keras, and others.

Assignments Overview:


Assignment 1: Text Extraction and Preprocessing
Description: This assignment focuses on extracting text from web pages, cleaning and preprocessing the text, and performing basic NLP tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal.



Assignment 2: Text Generation with OpenAI
Description: In this assignment, you will use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate documents based on user input phrases. The generated documents are then processed to remove HTML tags, normalize text, tokenize, lemmatize, and remove stop words.



Assignment 3: FastText and Word2Vec Models
Description: This assignment involves training FastText and Word2Vec models on a corpus of Yelp tips. The models are used to find similar and dissimilar words, demonstrating word embedding capabilities.



Assignment 4: Sentiment Analysis with CNN Models
Description: This assignment focuses on sentiment analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Multiple CNN architectures are implemented and evaluated for their performance on the Sentiment140 dataset.


Assignment 5: Character and Word-based Prediction Models
Description: In this assignment, you will build and train character-level and word-level prediction models using SimpleRNN and LSTM architectures. The models are evaluated for their accuracy in predicting the next character or word in a sequence.
